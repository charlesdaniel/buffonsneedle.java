## Buffon's Needle Drop Problem

### Introduction

This is a Java simulation implementation of the old [Buffon's Needle Drop experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon's_needle). It's basically a graphical Monte Carlo simulation of needles being dropped on parallel strips of wood to calculate an estimate of PI.

### TL;DR
This will build and run the GUI version

    make
    
### Compiling
    make build
OR

    javac GraphicSimulator.java

### Running
    make run_gui
OR

    java GraphicSimulator
    
### Disclaimer

This is my old University CompSci homework from 2002 (Java has changed since then). While this code is being made public domain, I do ask that you keep your Academic Integrity and not copy this code blindly for your own homework assignment.
